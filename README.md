Udacity-Courses
===============

This repo will serve as a way to both save some of the exercises/challenges/homeworks that I decide can be done outside of a browser and it will also serve as a way for to look back on in case I need a refresher on any topics. 

I will attempt to go through a few of the courses including: 
- Intro to Computer Science
- Web Development
- Algorithms
- Software Testing
- Software Debugging

##Why are doing this? 
Well, I always wanted to learn Python and I've heard a lot of great things about Udacity's free courses. At the very least, I'll learn something new. 

##Why are you posting it here?
Putting the exercises up on Github will serve as motivation for me to push finished code regularly, no matter how trivial the code might seem to me. Also, if I do something wrong, someone will either correct me or have a laugh at my expense.
